# Copy locked Google Drive files

This is a code to allow copying locked files from google docs.

## Use

1. Open the link to the file and change the "/edit" at the end to "/mobilebasic"
2. Open Developer Console [**Ctrl + Shift + C** for Windows or **Cmd + Shift + C** for Mac].
3. Open the Command Console [**Ctrl+Shift+P** for Windows or **Cmd + Shift + C** for Mac].
4. Search “javascript”, and select the option “Disable Javascript“.
5. Click the Console Tab, type **"allow pasting"** and hit **Enter**.
6. Paste the raw code and hit **Enter**.
7. Do ***NOT*** close the Dev Console and reload the page.
7.1. If you want to copy more than one file, paste the new URL before "/mobilebasic" without everything after "/edit" and reload.
8. When you're done, you can close Dev Tools.
